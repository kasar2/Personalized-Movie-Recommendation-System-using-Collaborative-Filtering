Introduction
With the exponential growth of online streaming platforms, users are often overwhelmed by the vast array of available content. To address this challenge, recommendation systems have emerged as a vital tool for guiding users toward content that aligns with their preferences. This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering, a popular approach that leverages user behavior and preferences to make predictions.

Methodology

1.Data Collection
The system utilizes a user-movie ratings matrix, where rows represent users and columns represent movies. Each entry in the matrix contains a rating (e.g., 1 to 5) or a 0 for unrated movies. The dataset used for this project consists of ratings for 20 movies from 20 users, stored in a CSV file.

2.System Architecture
The movie recommendation system is structured into several key components:

3.Data Loading: A function to load the ratings matrix from a CSV file.

Similarity Calculation: A function to compute the similarity between users based on their ratings using the cosine similarity metric.

Rating Prediction: A function to predict ratings for unrated movies based on the weighted average of ratings from similar users.

Recommendation Generation: A function to generate a ranked list of the top N recommended movies for a specific user.


4.Implementation
The system was implemented in C++ and consists of modular, well-documented code. The main components of the code include:

Loading Ratings: The program reads the CSV file and populates the ratings matrix.

Calculating Similarities: The cosine similarity between users is calculated to identify users with similar tastes.

Predicting Ratings: The system predicts ratings for unrated movies based on the ratings of similar users.

Generating Recommendations: The top N movies with the highest predicted ratings are recommended to the user.

5.Results
The system was tested with various users to evaluate its performance. The predicted ratings for unrated movies were generated, and a ranked list of recommended movies was produced. The recommendations were based on the collaborative filtering approach, which effectively identified movies that users with similar preferences enjoyed.

6.Performance Metrics
To assess the accuracy of the recommendations, metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) can be calculated by comparing predicted ratings with actual ratings (if available). The system's performance can be summarized as follows:

Accuracy: The system demonstrated a reasonable level of accuracy in predicting user ratings.

User Satisfaction: Users reported increased satisfaction with the recommendations provided by the system.


7.Conclusion
The personalized movie recommendation system developed using collaborative filtering in C++ successfully predicts user ratings and generates tailored movie recommendations. The implementation showcases the effectiveness of collaborative filtering techniques in enhancing user experience in content consumption. Future work may involve incorporating additional features such as content-based filtering and exploring advanced machine learning algorithms to further improve recommendation accuracy.

8.Future Work
Future enhancements to the system could include:

A.Incorporating Content-Based Filtering: Combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering to improve recommendations.
B.Utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms: Exploring advanced algorithms such as matrix factorization or deep learning techniques for better prediction accuracy.
C.User Interface Development: Creating a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with the recommendation system.
